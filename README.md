# backOUT
backOut is a story game, inspired by black out poetry and the choose your own adventure, about emphasis and what redaction means. The protagonist is a young woman who has made a mistake and hopes to correct it, magically; to play, choose from the available terms what she should be focusing on.

## Planning process
I planned to write a choose your own adventure, where particular sentences would be displayed as a result of a players selecting a certain clickable word -- and words would be redacted on the basis of that same choice, with the game's hope and wisdom stats reflecting consequences. To do this, I thought I needed to have sentences that owned words, with words having keys for their clickability and whether or not they were redacted, as well as a link to the next step.


## Future Improvements
I have not reached what I would consider the core functionality of the application: the ability to see an evolving story. At present, I believe I was a bit foolish in my reliance on the backend to the extent that I did; in order to be able to display redacted words in a story, I had users that owned sentences that owned words that owned steps, with the 'story' living in seeded equivalent tables. This made for an incredible burden on JS promises. I need to streamline the number of requests; I'm considering eliminating the seeded components on the backend and simply having a javasript object representing possible sentences, with a switch conditional directing to the appropriate sentence.

## Gratitudes
- Shaun White wrote a misspelled inspirational message on the classroom white board, and I'm grateful for all of that.
- Maria Ines, Naida Rosenberger, Sarah Burke, Kostant Stanton, Virginia Donaire, Kate Lindsay, and Rebecca Coras were key components in my mental health in building this.
- Danny Kirschner and Nate Dunn were both excellent advisers on the structure of the database and the structure of the application.
- Mike Finneran was of great assistance in tackling serialization issues.
- Dan Soszynski graciously got me maple syrup upon request (as well as a lint roller!).
